## Design

Everybody loves to dance. But with the current situation, dancing with our friends isn't really good practice. So what about making dance alone (even more) funny? That's the plan: we play the music, we plan the moves, you dance. Sounds pretty cool, doesn't it?



## Us

We bring together students of the fourth classes of ITIS Delpozzo of Cuneo, (on their way to becoming) specialized in robotics and computer science:

+ Aimar Veronica
+ De Giovannini Alessia
+ Giraudo Samuele
+ Jomini Pietro
